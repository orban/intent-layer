# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit
6. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan

## Process Flow

```dot
digraph brainstorming {
    "Explore project context" [shape=box];
    "Ask clarifying questions" [shape=box];
    "Propose 2-3 approaches" [shape=box];
    "Present design sections" [shape=box];
    "User approves design?" [shape=diamond];
    "Write design doc" [shape=box];
    "Invoke writing-plans skill" [shape=doublecircle];

    "Explore project context" -> "Ask clarifying questions";
    "Ask clarifying questions" -> "Propose 2-3 approaches";
    "Propose 2-3 approaches" -> "Present design sections";
    "Present design sections" -> "User approves design?";
    "User approves design?" -> "Present design sections" [label="no, revise"];
    "User approves design?" -> "Write design doc" [label="yes"];
    "Write design doc" -> "Invoke writing-plans skill";
}
```

**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Implementation:**
- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me trace through the entire conversation chronologically:

1. User starts with `/context` command showing their context usage (67.7k/200k tokens, 34%)

2. User asks: "What can we learn so far from the results that will help us to prepare for a larger run?" - This is about the AGENTbench replication project eval harness results.

3. I explored the eval harness results thoroughly, reading all JSON result files, and provided a detailed analysis identifying 6 concrete recommendations:
   - Add pre-validation step
   - Fix 600s timeout / silent generation failure
   - Fix lines_changed measurement to exclude context files
   - Graduate past the one easy task
   - Plan for repetitions (5+ per task-condition pair)
   - Separate success rate from efficiency metrics

4. User says: "implement all" - Clear directive to implement all 6 recommendations.

5. I invoked the brainstorming skill (as required by superpowers process), but quickly recognized the brainstorming was already done in the analysis phase and moved to implementation.

6. I created a todo list and launched an Explore agent to thoroughly understand the eval harness codebase.

7. Read all key files: task_runner.py, git_ops.py, reporter.py, cli.py, models.py, claude_runner.py, docker_runner.py, prompt_builder.py, test_task_runner.py, test_reporter.py

8. Started implementing changes:

**Change 1: git_ops.py - Exclude context files from diff measurement**
- Added `_CONTEXT_FILE_PATTERNS` regex to match AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .github/, .claude/, .cursor/, .cursorrules
- Added `_is_context_file()` helper
- Modified `get_diff_stats()` to use `--numstat` for per-file granularity when `exclude_context_files=True`
- Filters out context files from both `files` list and `lines_changed` count

**Change 2: task_runner.py - Pre-validation + generation failure detection**
- Added `PreValidationError` and `SkillGenerationError` exception classes
- Added `_pre_validate()` method that checks:
  - Docker setup + test command works
  - Test actually FAILS at pre_fix_commit (for failing_test tasks)
  - No residual context files after stripping
- Moved strip before pre-validate (was: setup → strip → generate; now: setup removed from before strip, strip → pre_validate → generate)
  Wait, looking more carefully: I moved the docker setup commands out of the run flow... Let me check. Actually no - looking at the edit, I removed the docker setup loop from the run() method. That's a problem! The pre_validate method chains setup commands itself, but the main test runner also needs them.
  
  Actually wait, looking more carefully at my edit of the `run()` method - I replaced the section from "Run docker setup" through "NONE: no generation", and in my new version I removed the docker setup loop that was at lines 273-275. The pre_validate method handles running tests with setup chained, but the rest of the flow (building prompts, running Claude, running final tests) still chains setup. So removing the standalone docker setup loop should be fine since it was running setup commands in Docker containers that are ephemeral anyway. Each subsequent docker run creates a new container, so pre-running setup in a separate container doesn't help. Let me verify... yes, the test command at line 336-346 chains setup commands, and the prompt building at lines 414-435 also chains setup. So the standalone loop was actually redundant - each Docker invocation is independent.

- Added generation failure detection: after skill generation, checks if `files_created` is empty (non-cache) and raises `SkillGenerationError`
- Added three separate except blocks: PreValidationError → [pre-validation], SkillGenerationError → [skill-generation], Exception → [infrastructure]

**Change 3: reporter.py - Updated _is_infra_error**
- Now recognizes `[pre-validation]` and `[skill-generation]` error tags in addition to `[infrastructure]`

**Change 4: cli.py - Repetition support**
- Added `--repetitions/-n` flag (default: 1)
- Work queue now includes repetition index: `(repo, task, cond, rep)`
- Output shows `[rep N/M]` tag when repetitions > 1
- `run_single` unpacks the 4-tuple

**Change 5: reporter.py - Major rewrite for multi-run aggregation**
- Replaced `compile_results` to group by (task_id, condition) with lists instead of single results
- Added `_serialize_condition()` - for single runs backward-compatible, for multiple runs adds "runs" array + "median" summary
- Added `_get_fix_metrics()` static method for extracting metrics from either format
- Replaced `_compute_single_delta` with `_compute_delta` that works with lists and uses medians
- Success rate separated from efficiency metrics: `success_rate`, `successes`, `total_valid_runs` fields

**Current state of implementation:**
- ✅ git_ops.py - context file exclusion
- ✅ task_runner.py - pre-validation + generation failure detection  
- ✅ reporter.py - _is_infra_error updated + major rewrite for repetitions + separated metrics
- ✅ cli.py - repetition flag + work queue
- 🔄 reporter.py - write_markdown needs updating for new data format
- ❌ Tests not yet updated
- ❌ "Move past easy task" - this is about running harder tasks, not code changes per se

**Errors encountered:**
- One error: tried to edit reporter.py without reading it first (got "File has not been read yet" error), then re-read and successfully edited.

**Pending from todo list:**
1. ✅ Explore harness codebase
2. ✅ Pre-validation step
3. ✅ Fix 600s timeout / silent generation failure
4. ✅ Fix lines_changed measurement
5. ⏳ Move past the one easy task (this is operational, not code)
6. 🔄 Add repetition support (cli done, reporter partially done - markdown writer needs update)
7. 🔄 Separate success rate from efficiency metrics (reporter done, markdown writer needs update)

The most recent work was editing reporter.py - I just finished replacing `_serialize_result` and `_compute_single_delta` with the new multi-run aware methods. The `write_markdown` method still uses the old data format and needs updating to work with the new structure (it references fields like "time_percent" in deltas which is now the same, but it also uses `_get_fix_metrics` pattern for extracting data from conditions).

Wait, actually looking at `write_markdown`, it accesses `cond_data.get("success")`, `cond_data["fix_only"]`, etc. The new multi-run format adds `success_rate`, `median`, `runs` fields. The markdown writer needs to handle both formats. Also the delta key changed from `"success"` to `"success_rate_delta"`.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user asked "What can we learn so far from the results that will help us to prepare for a larger run?" about their AGENTbench replication eval harness. After I provided a detailed analysis with 6 concrete recommendations, the user said **"implement all"** — directing me to implement all six improvements:
   1. Add a pre-validation step (test works, test fails at pre_fix_commit, strip worked)
   2. Fix 600s timeout / silent generation failure detection
   3. Fix lines_changed to exclude context files from diffs
   4. Move past the one easy task (operational — run harder tasks)
   5. Add repetition support (N runs per condition, report medians)
   6. Separate success rate from efficiency metrics in reporting

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AGENTbench paper (arxiv 2602.11988) replication — testing whether hierarchical AGENTS.md files help vs hurt agent performance
   - Three-condition eval: none (no context), flat_llm (single CLAUDE.md), intent_layer (hierarchical AGENTS.md)
   - Docker-based test execution with workspace isolation
   - Skill generation with caching (IndexCache) — both flat and Intent Layer variants
   - Median-based aggregation for multiple repetitions (instead of means, due to 4x token variance)
   - Separated metrics: success rate as primary metric, efficiency (tokens, time, tool calls) as secondary
   - Pre-validation to avoid burning API tokens on broken tasks
   - Context file patterns: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .github/, .claude/, .cursor/, .cursorrules

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/lib/git_ops.py`** — Diff stats calculation, needed fixing to exclude context files from measurements
     - Added `_CONTEXT_FILE_PATTERNS` regex and `_is_context_file()` helper
     - Rewrote `get_diff_stats()` to use `git diff --numstat` for per-file filtering when `exclude_context_files=True` (default)
     ```python
     _CONTEXT_FILE_PATTERNS = re.compile(
         r"(^|/)("
         r"AGENTS\.md|CLAUDE\.md|\.github/|\.claude/|\.cursor/|\.cursorrules"
         r")"
     )
     
     def _is_context_file(path: str) -> bool:
         """Return True if path is an AI context file that shouldn't count in diffs."""
         return bool(_CONTEXT_FILE_PATTERNS.search(path))
     
     def get_diff_stats(repo_path: str, exclude_context_files: bool = True) -> DiffStats:
     ```

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/lib/task_runner.py`** — Main execution engine, needed pre-validation and generation failure detection
     - Added `PreValidationError` and `SkillGenerationError` exception classes
     - Added `_pre_validate()` method that verifies: docker+test works, test FAILS at pre_fix_commit, no residual context files
     - In `run()`: moved strip before pre_validate, removed standalone docker setup loop (was redundant — each docker invocation chains setup), added generation failure checks after skill generation
     - Added three distinct except blocks for different error categories
     ```python
     class PreValidationError(Exception):
         """Raised when a task fails pre-validation checks."""
         pass
     
     class SkillGenerationError(Exception):
         """Raised when skill generation fails (timeout or empty output)."""
         pass
     ```
     - Generation failure detection pattern:
     ```python
     if not skill_metrics.cache_hit and not skill_metrics.files_created:
         raise SkillGenerationError(
             f"Intent Layer generation produced no files "
             f"(took {skill_metrics.wall_clock_seconds:.0f}s). "
             f"Likely timed out or failed silently."
         )
     ```

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/lib/reporter.py`** — Results compilation and output, major rewrite for repetitions and separated metrics
     - Updated `_is_infra_error()` to recognize `[pre-validation]` and `[skill-generation]` tags
     - Rewrote `compile_results()` to group by (task_id, condition) with lists
     - Replaced `_serialize_result()` with `_serialize_single_result()` (same logic) and new `_serialize_condition()` for multi-run aggregation
     - Added `_get_fix_metrics()` static method for extracting metrics from either single or multi-run format
     - Replaced `_compute_single_delta()` with `_compute_delta()` using median-based comparison
     - Multi-run format includes: `success_rate`, `successes`, `total_valid_runs`, `median` dict, `runs` array
     ```python
     def _serialize_condition(self, runs: list[TaskResult]) -> dict:
         # Single run: backward-compatible
         if len(runs) == 1:
             return self._serialize_single_result(runs[0])
         # Multiple runs: success_rate + median efficiency + individual runs
         result["success_rate"] = round(successes / len(valid_runs), 2)
         result["median"] = {
             "wall_clock_seconds": ...,
             "input_tokens": ...,
             ...
         }
         result["runs"] = [self._serialize_single_result(r) for r in runs]
     ```

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/lib/cli.py`** — CLI entry point, needed repetition support
     - Added `--repetitions/-n` flag (default 1)
     - Work queue now 4-tuple: `(repo, task, cond, rep)`
     - Output shows `[rep N/M]` tag when repetitions > 1
     - Dry run shows repetition count

   - **Files read but not modified:**
     - `lib/models.py` — Task, RepoConfig, DockerConfig pydantic models
     - `lib/claude_runner.py` — Claude CLI runner with stream-json support
     - `lib/docker_runner.py` — Docker execution wrapper
     - `lib/prompt_builder.py` — Prompt templates for all conditions
     - `tests/test_task_runner.py` — Existing tests (22 tests)
     - `tests/test_reporter.py` — Existing tests (8 tests)
     - `eval-harness/tasks/fastmcp.yaml` — 8 active tasks across categories
     - All 11 result JSON files in `eval-harness/results/`

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **"File has not been read yet" error** when editing reporter.py: I tried to edit `_is_infra_error` in reporter.py after a context window gap without re-reading the file. Fixed by re-reading the file first, then applying the edit successfully.
   - No user feedback corrections — user only said "implement all" and let me work.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Identified that the docker setup loop in `run()` was redundant since each `run_in_docker` call creates a fresh container; setup commands are chained into each test/prompt invocation already
   - Designed backward-compatible reporter format: single runs produce the same JSON as before, multi-run only adds new fields
   - Used medians instead of means for aggregation due to observed 4x token variance in pilot data
   - Separated success rate (primary experimental metric) from efficiency metrics (secondary) in the data model

6. All User Messages:
   - `/context` command output (context usage dashboard)
   - "What can we learn so far from the results that will help us to prepare for a larger run?"
   - "implement all"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Update `write_markdown()` in reporter.py** — Still uses old data format; needs to handle new multi-run structure (success_rate, median, runs) and new delta key (`success_rate_delta` instead of `success`)
   - **Update tests** — `test_reporter.py` tests reference old method names (`_serialize_result`, `_compute_single_delta`) and old data structures; `test_task_runner.py` needs tests for `_pre_validate`, `PreValidationError`, `SkillGenerationError`
   - **Update `test_git_ops.py`** — needs tests for context file exclusion
   - **Run test suite** to verify all changes work together
   - **"Move past the one easy task"** — operational item, not a code change, but the fastmcp.yaml already has 8 tasks ready

8. Current Work:
   I was in the middle of updating `reporter.py`. I just finished replacing the core serialization and delta computation methods with multi-run aware versions. The `write_markdown()` method at the bottom of reporter.py still references the old data format and needs updating to work with the new `_serialize_condition()` output structure — specifically it accesses `cond_data.get("success")` (now `success_rate` in multi-run), and uses delta key `"success"` (now `"success_rate_delta"`).

9. Optional Next Step:
   Update `write_markdown()` in reporter.py to handle both single-run (backward compatible) and multi-run data formats, using the `_get_fix_metrics()` helper for extracting efficiency numbers. Then update the test files and run the test suite. This directly continues the "implement all" directive — the reporter rewrite is partially done with the core methods complete but the markdown output method still needs updating.

Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

Implement building the intent layer once and sharing it across runs to amortize the cost, we have use more have 600s if we're only doing it once

---

is the intent layer only built once in this design?

---

what i'm saying is that the generated intent layer files will be the same regardless of task, so we just need to get the files and then any task can use them

commit this

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me trace through the entire conversation chronologically:

1. This is a continuation session. The previous session implemented 6 recommendations for the AGENTbench eval harness:
   - Pre-validation step
   - Silent generation failure detection
   - Context file exclusion from diffs
   - Repetition support
   - Multi-run aggregation in reporter
   - Separated success/efficiency metrics

2. The continuation started with me re-reading reporter.py, test_reporter.py, and test_task_runner.py to understand the current state.

3. I updated `write_markdown()` in reporter.py to handle the new multi-run data format using `_get_fix_metrics()` helper.

4. I updated test_reporter.py - changed delta key from `"success"` to `"success_rate_delta"`, added tests for pre-validation/skill-gen error exclusion, multi-run serialize, multi-run delta, and _get_fix_metrics.

5. I updated test_task_runner.py - added import for PreValidationError/SkillGenerationError, added tests for those exceptions, residual context file detection, and error tag classification.

6. I updated test_git_ops.py - added import for _is_context_file, added tests for context file detection patterns.

7. All 43 tests passed.

8. User asked: "Implement building the intent layer once and sharing it across runs to amortize the cost, we have use more have 600s if we're only doing it once"

9. I entered plan mode, launched explore and plan agents, designed a two-phase approach (prepare_template + run_from_template).

10. User asked: "is the intent layer only built once in this design?" - questioning my plan

11. I explained yes, per task×condition, but acknowledged clone sharing could go further.

12. User said: "what i'm saying is that the generated intent layer files will be the same regardless of task, so we just need to get the files and then any task can use them" — KEY FEEDBACK. The user pointed out my design was wrong. The IL is per-REPO, not per-task. All tasks for the same repo share the same generated files.

13. I recognized the simpler approach: just pre-warm the cache before the task loop. The IndexCache already keys by (repo, commit, condition), not by task. So warm it once, all tasks get cache hits.

14. I implemented:
    - Added `timeout` parameter to `_check_or_generate_index` (default 600)
    - Added `timeout` parameter to `_generate_flat_context` (default 600)
    - Added `warm_cache()` method to TaskRunner (default 900s timeout)
    - Fixed workspace naming: added `rep` parameter to `_setup_workspace` (now `-r{rep}` suffix)
    - Updated `run()` to accept and pass `rep` parameter
    - Updated `cli.py` with Phase 1 pre-warm loop before the parallel task loop
    - Fixed warmup_items to use dict with string keys (not Condition enum, which isn't sortable)
    - Added 4 new tests: workspace rep naming, default rep, warm_cache NONE returns None, warm_cache skips when cached

15. All 47 tests passed.

16. User asked: "so again, the intent layer is only generated once?" - still questioning

17. I confirmed: yes, warm_cache generates once, saves to IndexCache, all task runs get instant cache hits. Cache key is (repo_url, commit, condition) with no task ID.

18. User said: "commit this"

19. I ran git status, git diff --stat, git log. The changes are:
    - eval-harness/lib/cli.py (38 additions)
    - eval-harness/lib/task_runner.py (105 additions)
    - eval-harness/tests/test_task_runner.py (82 additions)
    
    These are unstaged. I was about to create the commit when the summary was requested.

Important files modified in THIS session (the continuation):

From the PREVIOUS session carried forward:
- eval-harness/lib/git_ops.py - context file exclusion
- eval-harness/lib/reporter.py - multi-run aggregation, write_markdown update
- eval-harness/tests/test_reporter.py - new tests
- eval-harness/tests/test_git_ops.py - new tests

But those were already committed in `75388d5 feat: repetitions, pre-validation, context file exclusion, multi-run stats`

Current uncommitted changes (THIS session's main work):
- eval-harness/lib/task_runner.py - warm_cache, timeout params, workspace naming
- eval-harness/lib/cli.py - pre-warm phase
- eval-harness/tests/test_task_runner.py - new tests

Also earlier in this session I updated reporter.py's write_markdown and test files, which appear to have been committed already in 75388d5.

Wait, looking at git status more carefully - the modified files are only cli.py, task_runner.py, and tests/test_task_runner.py. The reporter.py and test_reporter.py and test_git_ops.py changes must have already been committed. Looking at the commit message `75388d5 feat: repetitions, pre-validation, context file exclusion, multi-run stats` - yes, those were committed.

So the current uncommitted work is specifically the warm_cache / workspace naming changes.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to implement building the Intent Layer once and sharing it across all runs to amortize the cost. The user explicitly noted: "we have use more have 600s if we're only doing it once" (meaning we can afford more than 600s timeout since generation only happens once). 

   A critical piece of user feedback shaped the design: when I initially planned a per-task×condition template approach, the user corrected me twice:
   - "is the intent layer only built once in this design?" 
   - "what i'm saying is that the generated intent layer files will be the same regardless of task, so we just need to get the files and then any task can use them"
   
   This clarified that the IL generation is per-REPO, not per-task — all tasks sharing the same repo get identical generated files. The user also asked to "commit this" after implementation was complete.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AGENTbench replication eval harness with three conditions: none, flat_llm, intent_layer
   - IndexCache keyed by `(repo_url, commit, condition)` — repo-scoped, not task-scoped
   - Cache pre-warming: generate context files once before the parallel task loop, so all task runs get instant cache hits
   - Workspace collision bug: parallel repetitions sharing the same workspace path (no rep index)
   - `warm_cache()` method: clone into a throwaway workspace, generate, let cache persist the result, clean up
   - Two-phase CLI execution: serial pre-warm, then parallel task runs
   - Generation timeout: 900s for warm_cache (runs once) vs 600s default for task-level fallback

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/lib/task_runner.py`** (UNCOMMITTED - main implementation target)
     - Added `timeout` parameter to `_check_or_generate_index()` and `_generate_flat_context()` (both default 600s)
     - Added `warm_cache()` method (~70 lines) that pre-generates context into the cache
     - Fixed `_setup_workspace()` to include rep index in workspace name
     - Updated `run()` to accept and pass `rep` parameter
     ```python
     def warm_cache(
         self,
         repo_url: str,
         commit: str,
         condition: Condition,
         model: str | None = None,
         timeout: int = 900
     ) -> SkillGenerationMetrics | None:
         """Pre-generate context files for a repo+commit+condition into the cache.
         Called once per unique (repo, commit, condition) before the task loop.
         Subsequent task runs will get instant cache hits instead of regenerating.
         Uses a longer timeout (default 900s) since this only runs once.
         Returns SkillGenerationMetrics if generation was needed, None for the
         'none' condition (which has no context files to generate).
         """

     ```
     - `run()` signature update: `def run(self, task: Task, condition: Condition, model: str | None = None, rep: int = 0) -> TaskResult:`
     - `_check_or_generate_index` and `_generate_flat_context` both got `timeout: int = 600` parameter threaded through to `run_claude()`

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/lib/cli.py`** (UNCOMMITTED)
     - Added Phase 1 pre-warm cache loop before the parallel task execution
     - Fixed `run_single` to pass `rep=rep` to `runner.run()`
     ```python
     # Phase 1: Pre-warm cache — generate context files once per repo+condition.
     if not no_cache:
         warmup_items: dict[tuple[str, str, str], 'RepoConfig'] = {}
         for repo, task in all_tasks:
             for cond in conditions:
                 if cond == Condition.NONE:
                     continue
                 key = (repo.url, task.pre_fix_commit, cond.value)
                 if key not in warmup_items:
                     warmup_items[key] = repo
         if warmup_items:
             click.echo(f"Pre-warming cache for {len(warmup_items)} repo/condition pair(s)...")
             for (repo_url, commit, cond_str), repo_config in warmup_items.items():

                     metrics = runner.warm_cache(repo_url, commit, cond, model=model)
                     if metrics and not metrics.cache_hit:
                         click.echo(f"  {cond_str}: generated {len(metrics.files_created)} file(s) in {metrics.wall_clock_seconds:.1f}s")
                     else:

                     click.echo(f"  {cond_str}: warmup failed - {e}", err=True)
                     click.echo(f"    (task runs will retry with their own timeout)", err=True)
     ```
     - `run_single` now passes rep: `return runner.run(task, condition, model=model, rep=rep)`

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/tests/test_task_runner.py`** (UNCOMMITTED)
     - Added 4 new tests:
     ```python
     def test_workspace_name_includes_rep(sample_repo):
         # Verifies -r0, -r1, -r5 suffixes and uniqueness
     
     def test_workspace_default_rep_is_zero(sample_repo):
         # Verifies backward compat: default rep=0 produces -r0
     
     def test_warm_cache_none_condition_returns_none(sample_repo):
         # NONE condition is a no-op
     
     def test_warm_cache_skips_when_cached(sample_repo):
         # Pre-populates cache, verifies warm_cache returns None
     ```

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/lib/reporter.py`** (already committed in 75388d5)
     - Updated `write_markdown()` to handle multi-run format using `_get_fix_metrics()`
     - Added infrastructure errors count to summary section

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/tests/test_reporter.py`** (already committed in 75388d5)
     - Fixed delta key `"success"` → `"success_rate_delta"`
     - Added tests: pre_validation/skill_gen errors excluded, multi_run_serialize_condition, multi_run_delta, get_fix_metrics_all_formats

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/tests/test_git_ops.py`** (already committed in 75388d5)
     - Added `_is_context_file` import and 7 tests for context file pattern matching

   - **`/Users/ryo/dev/intent-layer/eval-harness/lib/index_cache.py`** (read, not modified)
     - Cache keyed by `(repo_url, commit, condition)` — this repo-scoped design is what enables the simple pre-warm approach

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Initial design was wrong (user feedback)**: I designed a per-task×condition template approach where each task would get its own template workspace. The user corrected me: "what i'm saying is that the generated intent layer files will be the same regardless of task, so we just need to get the files and then any task can use them." I pivoted to the much simpler cache pre-warm approach.
   - **Condition enum not sortable**: Initially used `sorted(warmup_keys)` where keys contained `Condition` enum values. Fixed by storing `cond.value` (string) in the key instead, and using a dict instead of a set to keep the repo config reference.
   - **repo_for_warmup was wrong**: Initially grabbed `all_tasks[0][0]` as a single repo config for all warmups. Fixed by keeping a dict mapping each unique key to its corresponding repo config.
   - **ExitPlanMode tool failures**: The ExitPlanMode tool failed repeatedly with "Error: Stream closed". I worked around this by explaining the plan in text and asking the user for approval directly.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved the workspace collision bug where `--repetitions > 1` would cause parallel workers to clobber each other's workspaces (same path, no rep index).
   - Solved the redundant generation problem by pre-warming the cache serially before the parallel task loop.
   - The approach is minimal: no restructuring of `run()`, no new data classes, just a `warm_cache()` method and a pre-warm loop in the CLI. The existing cache infrastructure handles everything.

6. All user messages:
   - "Implement building the intent layer once and sharing it across runs to amortize the cost, we have use more have 600s if we're only doing it once"
   - "is the intent layer only built once in this design?"
   - "what i'm saying is that the generated intent layer files will be the same regardless of task, so we just need to get the files and then any task can use them"
   - "so again, the intent layer is only generated once?"
   - "commit this"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Commit the current changes** — user explicitly asked "commit this". Git status shows 3 modified files (cli.py, task_runner.py, tests/test_task_runner.py), unstaged. I had run git status/diff/log but hadn't created the commit yet.

8. Current Work:
   The user asked "commit this" and I ran the three preparatory git commands (status, diff --stat, log). The diff shows:
   - `eval-harness/lib/cli.py` — 38 insertions (pre-warm phase)
   - `eval-harness/lib/task_runner.py` — 105 insertions (warm_cache, timeout params, workspace naming)
   - `eval-harness/tests/test_task_runner.py` — 82 insertions (4 new tests)
   
   All 47 tests pass. I need to stage these files and create the commit.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Create the git commit with these 3 files. Based on the repo's commit style (`feat:`, `fix:`, lowercase, imperative), an appropriate message would be something like: `feat: pre-warm cache to generate context once per repo, fix workspace collision`. Stage only the 3 modified files (not the untracked results/logs/etc.), then commit.
