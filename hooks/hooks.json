Consider ALL learning types:\n\n1. **Pitfalls** - Things that went wrong, gotchas to avoid\n2. **Checks** - Verifications needed before certain actions\n3. **Patterns** - Better approaches discovered, preferred practices\n4. **Insights** - Important context or background learned\n\nLook for:\n- User corrections to your assumptions\n- Unexpected behaviors discovered\n- Better approaches you figured out\n- Important context that should be documented\n\n## Response\n\nIf learnings should be captured, respond with:\n{\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"Before ending: run capture_mistake.sh --type [pitfall|check|pattern|insight] to capture: [brief description]\"}\n\nIf no learnings worth documenting:\n{\"ok\": true}\n\nBe conservative - only flag genuine documentation gaps.
