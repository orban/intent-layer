Unexpected behaviors discovered\n2. User corrections to your assumptions\n3. Things you figured out that should have been documented\n\n## Response\n\nIf skeletons need enrichment OR genuine learnings were discovered, respond with:\n{\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"Before ending: [specific action - either enrich skeleton X with [details], or run capture_mistake.sh to capture: [description]]\"}\n\nIf all skeletons are exploratory failures AND no other learnings, respond with:\n{\"ok\": true}\n\nBe conservative - only flag genuine documentation gaps, not normal development activities. Exploratory failures (file not found, wrong path, typos) should be discarded, not documented.",
